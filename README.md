PCB Arduino Uno Rev3 Schematic and Board with Eagle

The Arduino uno board is a microcontroller board (Development Board) using the ATmega328 microcontroller chip which is flexible and open-source, 
the software and hardware are relatively easy to use so it is widely used by beginners to experts. To be able to use the Arduino Uno board,
it is connected to a computer using USB cable or with adapter or 7-12 V DC Power Supply. 

Arduino Uno can be used to detect the environment by reading data from various sensors, for example distance, infrared, temperature, light, ultrasonic, pressure, humidity and others.
